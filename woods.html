    <h1> The Woods: A Shifting Landscape Shaped by Human Care</h1>
    <h5> Moore begins by constructing the woods as an alluring, almost mythic setting, describing 
        “the cool, shadowy smell” and “the velvet of moss on rock,” which draws Tracy into an atmosphere 
        of intimacy rather than immediate danger (Moore 37). This lush sensory imagery presents the forest 
        as a space shaped by imagination and adolescent curiosity, where fear still feels distant and manageable. 
        The setting’s early enchantment suggests that safety is defined by the natural environment itself, not by 
        the reliability of adults. <br><br>

        As Tracy becomes genuinely lost, however, the forest’s imagery fractures. Time “seems to move strangely,”
         and she enters “a different reality,” which destabilizes her sense of orientation and shifts the tone 
         from dreamy to surreal and threatening (Moore 180). The woods themselves have not changed. Instead, Tracy’s 
         perception shifts once the structures meant to protect her fail to intervene. The evolving setting begins to 
         mirror her psychological dislocation, reflecting the confusion of a child left without guidance when institutional 
         rules, adult supervision, and meaningful response fall away. <br><br>
        
        Barbara’s later retreat into the woods strengthens the motif of the forest as a space whose danger 
        depends on the presence or absence of human care. Her isolation reveals that the forest becomes a refuge 
        not because it offers safety on its own terms, but because the human world has grown chaotic, accusatory, 
        and incapable of understanding her. By tracing these shifts across Tracy’s disorientation and Barbara’s 
        withdrawal, Moore shows that the wilderness remains constant while the real threat emerges from human 
        misjudgment and inaction. Through this progression, the woods evolve from imagined danger to reflected truth, 
        exposing the social landscape as far more treacherous than the natural one.
