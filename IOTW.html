    <h6> Throughout <i>God of the Woods</i>, Liz Moore uses the evolving motifs of the woods, camp safety rules, 
        performance, hunger, and concealed evidence to reveal that danger does not originate in the natural 
        world but in the social systems meant to protect children. As setting, tone, and characterization shift 
        across these motifs, moments that appear harmless become sites where adults misinterpret, neglect, or 
        actively distort the truth. Moore demonstrates that harm arises when institutions prioritize image over 
        honesty, routine over responsibility, and self-preservation over care. The novel ultimately argues that 
        genuine safety comes not from rules, rituals, or appearances but from adults who are willing to see children 
        clearly, respond with integrity, and confront the uncomfortable realities they have long avoided.
