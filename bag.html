    <h1> Bags and Evidence: Detaining Truth to Preserve Power </h1> 
    <h5> Moore transforms bags and evidence-handling into a developing motif to depict how truth becomes something that 
        can be contained, transferred, or repurposed when adults fear accountability. <br><br>
        Initially, Moore utilizes the motif to expose how characters absorb the adult world’s impulse to 
        manage uncertainty by controlling the objects connected to the truth. The motif begins when Louise 
        gathers the debris around Barbara’s bunk into a brown paper bag containing “an empty bottle of beer… 
        the end of a joint… the vomit-filled potato chip bag” and tells Annabel that it “needs to be gotten rid of” 
        (Moore 17). Although this moment looks like simple cleanup, Louise’s instinct to remove the items reveals her 
        internalization of a culture where image matters more than understanding. The bag becomes a symbol of avoidance 
        rather than curiosity, suggesting that even adolescents have learned to treat uncomfortable evidence as something to 
        erase instead of confront. This introduces a pattern in which physical objects are managed not to reveal truth, 
        but to prevent disruption. <br><br>
        When the same bag resurfaces during Louise’s interrogation, the stakes heighten. 
        Denny Hayes sets it “on the vanity” and tells her, “Found your bag,” transforming the ordinary paper sack 
        into an object loaded with accusation (Moore 197). By placing the bag prominently in front of her, Hayes reframes 
        it as proof linked directly to Louise, even though its contents remain unchanged. This moment demonstrates how 
        authority figures can seize an ambiguous object and impose meaning onto it, reshaping uncertainty into implied guilt. 
        The bag stops being evidence about the situation and becomes evidence against Louise. Moore employs this shift to show 
        how easily truth becomes manipulated when institutions feel pressure to appear competent. <br><br>
        The motif reaches its most coercive form when Detective Lowry informs Louise that “John Paul… has been found with a 
        bag of Barbara’s clothing. Bloody” (Moore 272). The strategic placement of “bloody” at the end of the sentence gives 
        the word emotional weight, allowing it to overshadow any missing context. The bag becomes a dramatic prop, something 
        Lowry relies on to construct a narrative that centers Louise as responsible. The object’s ambiguity disappears under 
        the emotional charge of the word, revealing how institutional power converts suggestive details into certainty. 
        For Lowry, the usefulness of the bag lies not in what it clarifies but in how effectively it pressures Louise and 
        protects his authority. <br><br>
        Through these escalating appearances, Moore shows how bags evolve from containers of messy reality into 
        instruments for shaping stories that benefit the powerful. Instead of guiding characters toward clarity, the 
        objects become tools for redirecting blame and controlling fear. This pattern reinforces the novel’s broader 
        argument: the greatest danger does not come from the woods but from adults who reshape truth to preserve their own 
        image. In a world where evidence becomes a vessel for reputation rather than understanding, vulnerable characters 
        like Louise are forced to bear the weight of stories created to protect everyone but them.
