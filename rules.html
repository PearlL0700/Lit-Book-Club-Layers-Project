    <h1> The Empty Reassurance of Camp Rules </h1>
    <h5>
        Moore develops the camp rule “When lost, sit down and yell” as a motif that exposes the gap between 
        institutional instruction and genuine care. Introduced as a cheerful ritual, the rule is chanted in 
        “playful unison,” creating a tone of performance rather than seriousness (Moore 36). The rhythmic repetition 
        throughout the story makes the rule feel scripted, suggesting that the camp values the appearance of preparedness 
        more than an understanding of how fear actually feels. The rule becomes a symbolic reassurance, something meant to 
        signal safety without requiring adults to engage emotionally. <br><br>

        The rule’s meaning shifts when Tracy becomes lost. Her shouting “I’M LOST” only brings “self-loathing and 
        embarrassment,” revealing that the rule becomes painful the moment it is used sincerely (Moore 179). The 
        irony is central to the motif. A guideline meant to protect instead isolates her, because it offers instruction w
        ithout support. Moore intensifies this shift when Tracy’s voice changes from the memorized phrase into “guttural 
        primal howls… punctuated… with ‘Mom, Dad’” (Moore 180). This moment marks the collapse of the rule’s authority. 
        Tracy moves beyond institutional language into instinct, exhibiting that rehearsed words cannot carry the weight of 
        real terror. The polished chant disappears the moment she needs genuine comfort, revealing that the system has taught 
        her what to say, but not how to be cared for. <br><br>

        As a motif, the rule comes to represent the community’s broader failure to confront vulnerability. T
        racy’s instinctive cries expose the emotional truth the rule attempts to hide: children do not need slogans, 
        they need presence, honesty, and adults willing to acknowledge fear rather than manage it. The progression of 
        the rule from playful chant, to humiliating command, to emotional collapse reflects the novel’s critique of 
        systems that rely on orderly language instead of responsibility. By showing the camp rule failing at the moment 
        it matters most, Moore reveals how adults protect themselves with reassuring phrases while leaving children 
        unprotected. This motif reinforces the novel’s argument that danger arises not from being lost in the woods, 
        but from being placed in systems that mistake rules for care and authority for accountability.
