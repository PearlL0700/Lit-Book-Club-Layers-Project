    <h1> Introduction</h1>
    <h5> In <i>God of the Woods</i>, safety is something carefully arranged. Camp rules are practiced, 
        adults project control, and routines are meant to ensure that children remain protected. 
        Yet when a child disappears, these structures begin to falter. What once seemed dependable 
        reveals itself as fragile, and the systems designed to offer security start prioritizing order 
        over understanding. Instead of confronting uncertainty, adults rely on procedures, appearances, 
        and objects to manage what they cannot explain. As the novel unfolds, Moore repeatedly returns 
        to specific settings, rituals, and objects that appear ordinary at first but grow increasingly 
        charged as fear, neglect, and institutional pressure intensify. <br><br>

        There are five motifs on the next page that trace this progression, revealing how danger gradually 
        moves away from the wilderness itself and into the social world that fails to reckon with its own responsibility.
