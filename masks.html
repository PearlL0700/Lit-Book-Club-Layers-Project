    <h1> Performance and Roles: Identity Shaped by Expectation </h1>
    <h5> 
        Moore develops performance as a recurring motif that initially appears harmless and child-controlled. 
        At camp, the counselors are described as “celebrities… whispered about in the dark,” language that 
        creates a playful tone and shows how children observe, admire, and imitate those they look up to (Moore 33).
        This kind of performance functions as imaginative play rather than pressure. The children are not required 
        to act a certain way or uphold authority; instead, they experiment with roles through admiration and imitation, 
        imagining what it might feel like to hold confidence, independence, or status. Because these roles are optional 
        and consequence-free, performance at this stage feels flexible and exploratory. Moore presents this early form of 
        performance to show what it looks like when identity is shaped by curiosity rather than fear or expectation.
         <br> <br>

        As the novel progresses, Moore redefines performance by showing how it becomes an adult-imposed necessity rather 
        than a child’s choice. When Barbara disappears, Louise instructs others, “Do not say missing… say she is not in 
        her bunk” (Moore 56). This adjustment is not about accuracy but about control. The word “missing” demands urgency 
        and accountability, while “not in her bunk” minimizes the situation and delays panic. By choosing language that 
        downplays danger, adults construct a version of calm that prioritizes institutional order over truth. At this moment, 
        performance stops being imaginative and becomes compulsory. Louise is expected to project competence and reassurance, 
        even as the reality beneath that performance grows more serious. She is not expressing confidence; she is acting it 
        because the system requires the appearance of stability. <br><br>

        The motif reaches its most damaging form when Barbara discovers that her mural has been painted over so adults 
        can host a party. Her protest, “All that work… without my permission,” exposes how completely adult performance 
        depends on erasing a child’s inner life when it becomes inconvenient (Moore 366). The phrase “all that work” captures 
        the emotional effort Barbara poured into creating something personal and expressive. “Without my permission” reveals 
        how little authority she has over her own voice or creations. In this moment, performance becomes an act of replacement. 
        Adults do not merely manage appearances; they overwrite a child’s self-expression to preserve a polished social image. 
        Barbara’s identity is sacrificed so the adults can continue performing normalcy. <br><br>

        Through this progression, Moore underscores how the motif of performance moves from playful imitation to 
        enforced composure and finally to emotional silencing. What begins as admiration becomes expectation, and 
        expectation becomes erasure. Adults rely on rehearsed roles and controlled appearances to avoid confronting 
        harm, even when doing so requires ignoring or dismantling a child’s voice. This evolution reinforces the novel’s 
        central argument that danger in God of the Woods does not arise from the wilderness itself, but from a social 
        system that values looking stable over being honest, and performance over care.
